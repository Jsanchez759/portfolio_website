            <h3>SpaceX Rocket Landing Classification</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>This Machine Learning project focuses on predicting whether a SpaceX rocket will successfully land on the ground or not, using data obtained through the SpaceX API. The ability to predict the outcome of a rocket landing is essential for ensuring the safety and success of space missions.
                  This project was developed in a complete way, from data exploration, development, modeling and testing of different models, to an application to consume the chosen model through FastAPI.
